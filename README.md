This repository contains programs to calculate self-consistent mean-field solutions of subsystem symmetry breaking condensates in van der Waals heterostructures.

How to run?
---

You will need to install [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and the [IJulia](https://juliapackages.com/p/ijulia) package to run the Jupyter Notebook `identical_parabolic_many_bands_constant_density_realistic_parameters.ipynb`.

You also need Jupyter to open the notebook, but you can also use VSCode instead.

The other notebook, `data_and_plots.ipynb` is used for gathering and plotting the generated data.
